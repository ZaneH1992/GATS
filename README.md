# GATS
This tutorial walks through the implementation of Generative Adverserial Tree Search (GATS), 
an RL method which exploits the experinaces to learn both the model dynamics and the Q function.
The model in this tutorial follows the work described in the paper 
[Surprising Negative Results for Generative Adversarial Tree Search](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1806.05780.pdf), by Kamyar Azizzadenesheli, Brandon Yang, Weitang Liu, Emma Brunskill, Zachary Lipton, and Animashree Anandkumar
